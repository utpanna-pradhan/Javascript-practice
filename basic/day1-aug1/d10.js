console.log([] == ![]) //true as in == it only compares the value .[] takes as '' which is false
console.log({} + []) //both are object so when we add them they result in [object object]
console.log([] + {}) //both are object so when we add them they result in [object object]
console.log(null == 0) // null has value null which is not 0 that's why it result in false
